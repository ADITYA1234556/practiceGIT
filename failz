git squash practice
git suqash is merging 3-4 commits in one commit
if commits are merged they cant be unmerged in seperate commits again
to go squash type git rebase -i headÂ¬3

differbec b.w git types soft mixed and hard 
git reset --soft <commit id>
git reset --hard <commit id>
soft keeps the files and marges the commit 
hard deletes the changes after the commit id chosen  
git fetch change
new commit
git pull if new commits in same file it will still pull

To add a remote repo to local machine repo after git init
git remote add origin SSHliknk if ssh access token is created or else we use HTTPS link
git remote -v to check the version
to change the origin url
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git


TO add ssh token for avoiding token login for git push
add ssh and gpg keys -> go to genereate new SSH ->take this code from there to use in our linux machine CLI 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "adityanavaneethan98@gmail.com" put this command with your email ID and hit enter
now in .ssh path we will have two more file cat the .pub content and paste it in SSHANDGPG keys -> add new SSH key give title and paste the content of .pub file and add SSH key.

how to delete a branch
