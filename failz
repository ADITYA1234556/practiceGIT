git squash practice
git suqash is merging 3-4 commits in one commit
if commits are merged they cant be unmerged in seperate commits again
to go squash type git rebase -i headÂ¬3

differbec b.w git types soft mixed and hard 
git reset --soft <commit id>
git reset --hard <commit id>
soft keeps the files and marges the commit 
hard deletes the changes after the commit id chosen  
git fetch change
new commit
git pull if new commits in same file it will still pull

To add a remote repo to local machine repo after git init
git remote add origin SSHliknk if ssh access token is created or else we use HTTPS link
git remote -v to check the version
to change the origin url
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
